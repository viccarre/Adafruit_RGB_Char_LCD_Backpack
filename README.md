# Adafruit_RGB_Char_LCD_Backpack

##Overview

This library was created to control the [Adafruit's RGB Character LCD](https://www.adafruit.com/product/784) via Software Serial. 

##Instalation

The library was created using the Arduino IDE 1.0.5.

In order to correctly compile:

1. Download or fork this github project.
2. Open the Arduino IDE 1.0.5
3. In the Arduino IDE go to Sketch/Import Library.../Add Library 
4. Select the Adafruit_RGB_Char_LCD_Backpack folder 
5. We recomend to close and reopen the Arduino IDE and then go to file/Examples/Adafruit_RGB_Char_LCD_Backpack/demo
6. Connect the display to the Arduino (Vcc, GND and the serial pin of the board to the pin 2 of the Arduino)
	* Vcc -> Arduino's 5V
	* GND -> Arduino's GND
	* Serial -> Arduino's pin 2
7. Enjoy!

##Codebender

The Codebender project is available:

[https://codebender.cc/sketch:142178](https://codebender.cc/sketch:142178)


##Usage

You can explore the example project to understand how this library works, it's very easy to use. The libary was based in the [Adafruit's documentation](https://learn.adafruit.com/usb-plus-serial-backpack/command-reference) for this display. 

The next functions are available:

```
lcd_begin();
lcd_setContrast(int contrast); //max 255, 200 is good 
lcd_setBrightness(int brightness); //max 255
lcd_setCursorAtBeginning();
lcd_clear();
lcd_print(String message);
lcd_setColor(int red, int green, int blue);
lcd_autoscrollOn();
lcd_autoscrollOff();
lcd_setCursor(int column, int row);
lcd_underlineCursorOn();
lcd_underlineCursorOff();
lcd_blinkCursorOn();
lcd_blinkCursorOff();
lcd_cursorForward();
lcd_cursorBackward();

```

##Example

This is the example code inside the project

```
#include <SoftwareSerial.h>
#include "RGB_Char_LCD_Backpack.h"

void setup() {
  
  lcd_begin();
  lcd_setContrast(200);
  lcd_setBrightness(255);
  lcd_setCursorAtBeginning();
  lcd_clear();
  lcd_print("Hello Arduino!");
  lcd_setColor(255, 0, 0);
  lcd_autoscrollOff();
  lcd_blinkCursorOn();
  lcd_underlineCursorOn();
  delay(1000);
  lcd_clear();
  lcd_setCursorAtBeginning();
  lcd_print("Hello World!");
}

void loop() {
  	
}

```
